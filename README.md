# cat-or-dog
This project is built to classify images of cats and dogs using a machine learning model. The model has been trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes labeled images of cats and dogs.

The application allows users to select an image and the model predicts whether it belongs to the "cat" class or the "dog" class.
